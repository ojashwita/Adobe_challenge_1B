# Persona-Driven PDF Analyzer

This Python-based tool extracts relevant sections and subsections from academic or professional PDFs based on a target persona and job-to-be-done.

##  How It Works
- Accepts PDF(s) and optional `config.json`

- Scores & extracts most relevant content
- Outputs structured results as JSON
